I am a Master's student in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Amsterdam. I am interested in machine learning, natural language procesing and semantics.
</br></br>
I received a BSc degree in Electronics Engineering from Universidad Distrital Francisco José de Caldas at Bogotá, Colombia. <a href="https://github.com/dfdazac/bsc-thesis" target="_blank">My thesis</a> involved the application of artificial intelligence to the design and optimization of electrical machines.
</br></br>
In 2017 I created <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.deltaphi.drumatefree" target="_blank">Drumate</a>, an Android app for drummers that uses procedural generation of practice patterns, that as of today has about 100k downloads.

I share some of the things I learn here in the form of blog posts. Feel free to visit the Writing section!
