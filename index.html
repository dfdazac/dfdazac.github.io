My research focuses on machine learning for extraction of structured information, mainly in the form of graphs.
I am particularly interested in unsupervised learning methods that leverage large amounts of unlabeled data.
<br><br>
I write about machine learning algorithms and their implementations in my <a href="/blog/">blog</a>.
